## P1
Problem 1 was to design an algorithm to count the number of inversions in an array of numbers.

**P11:** Using a brute force algorithm

**P12:** Using a recursive divide and conquer algorithm - time complexity of O(nlogn)

## P2
Problem 2 was to design an algorithm to form a convex hull given an array of (x, y) coordinates. The shortest path around the conevex hull, given 2 points on the hull, was found.

**P21:** Using a brute force algorithm

**P22:** Using a recursive divide and conquer algorithm - time complexity of O(nlogn)

## Compilation and running instructions

**How to compile:**

P11: make P11

p12: make P12

p21: make P21

P22: make P22

**How to run:**

P11: ./P11

p12: ./P12

p21: ./P21

P22: ./P22

**More information on running times and compilation:**

P11.c takes around 10000 ms (10s)   

For compiling P21.c and P22.c -> included -lm for the math library

P21.c takes around 92000 ms (92 s)
